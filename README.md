# TopMusic
TopMusic is a client/server application which is focused on music. Clients will have an account and will listen to the music that can be found on the application. They can vote the songs, comment, add new music and see information (title, artist, a description, URL, etc.). There are also admins, which will try to keep the application clean by deleting songs with incorrect information, restricting users (not allowing them to vote, comment and add songs) and getting more help by giving admin rights to trusted regular users. The server is TCP concurrent. TopMusic doesn't have a graphical interface yet, but I am planning to do that in the future.
